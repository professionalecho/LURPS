## On Campus

The Tuesday and Thursday term-time meetings are held in Bowland North Seminar Room 10 while the Live games normally meet outside the Chaplaincy Centre. Click [here](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/maps/campus.pdf) for a map.

There is always a possibility that a meeting place will change; for this reason, keep tabs on our [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/hellolurps) and [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/hellolurps) pages.

## Getting to the University

The University can be accessed by car (see map below) or by bus numbers 2, 2A, and 3. All buses stop in the underpass just below Alexandra Square; check [the Stagecoach website](http://www.stagecoachbus.com) for bus timetable information.

## If All Else Fails...

If you get really lost on campus, don&rsquo;t panic! Post in the [Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/lurps), and somebody (probably one of the exec) will be happy to help you out.
