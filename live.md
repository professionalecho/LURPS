slogan: Live-action roleplaying, or LARPing, is a type of roleplaying where you are physically acting out the things you do, instead of just describing them. LURPS has a big tradition of LARPing, as detailed below.

## Obsidian Arcana
Obsidian Arcana is a fantastical setting of steampunk technology and amazing magics. Where the forces of civilisation wage war against ancient powers, insane science and a world gone mad.

The Free Nations has fallen and a new order has taken it's place, the Federated Nations. Imbued with the spirit of democracy, mankind has entered a new age. For the first time in centuries they are looking beyond the borders of what is known, both geographically and scientifically. The rise of the Old Gods, the mysterious lands over the oceans and across the mountains and the horrors of the Splinterverse.

The League of Exploration and Adventure, the premier club for those of an adventurous bent, are looking for recruits to deal with all of these. You play one of those intrepid figures looking to make their mark on the world.

Obsidian Arcana runs alternating Saturdays with Far Shores.

## Far Shores

Far Shores is a dark fantasy setting of action, exploration and political intrigue.

The world is recovering from the averted apocalyptic invasion of the devastating Legion. The gods' intervention came at the final hour, manifesting on the battlefield where the surviving members of shattered nations and dying races held their last stand against a foe that had devastated the Realms over ten brutal years of massacre. As a member of the Kingsriders, you are a part of a mercenary group commissioned by the High King to investigate and reclaim lost lands and discover the fates of their inhabitants.

This is a time for survival, not heroics. After all, all of the heroes are dead.

Far Shores runs alternating Saturdays with Obsidian Arcana.

## Vampires In Public

Vampires in Public is a modern-day horror LARP where the players are the newly fledged vampires of Lancaster, negotiating their way through the complexities of life in the supernatural world.
Current VIP is a mix of politics and horror, atmosphere and danger - we pride ourselves on having a detailed and extensive sandbox for players to explore. From nearby courts to local werewolves, from cosmic entities to human government, life as a vampire is rarely simple.

ViP runs every other week of term on Monday nights, meeting at Bowland Bar at 6pm.

## Fell Rune

Fell Rune is a game of mythic Vikings, set in a thoroughly ahistorical world where trolls lurk in the mountains, giant serpents swim in the seas, and the greatest warriors of times past sometimes descend from Valhalla to bestow favours upon their most cunning and bloodthirsty offspring. PCs are warriors and witches, tricksters and tale-tellers, seeking gold and a glorious death. Really, what more could you want?

Fell Rune is designed to be mechanically simple, and accessible to people unfamiliar with Live Action Role-Play. Your refs hope to offer an engaging and entertaining experience of high action and high drama, where all the necessary information about the world and the game can be explained on the day, and time spent on the game between sessions is entirely optional.

So come, drink mead and earn your place in Valhalla. FOR THE ANCESTORS!

Fell Rune generally runs once a term. Keep an eye on all the usual places for details.

## ...And More!

Several LARP groups run games in and around Lancaster, and from time to time they run games especially for LURPS. Many of these are horror based, like [Room Thirteen](https://roomthirteen.wordpress.com/), [Aeon Horror](http://www.aeonhorror.com), or [Shunned House](http://shunnedhouselrp.weebly.com/), but the nature of them is that anything can happen!

We also run  other one-offs throughout the term. Details for these will be announced at the regular Tuesday/Thursday meetings as well as on our Facebook group.
